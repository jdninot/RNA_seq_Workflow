# RNA-seq Count Data Analysis Workflow with DESeq2
Both basic and advanced workflow of RNA-seq count data analysis for the detection of differentially expressed genes is presented using the [DESeq2 package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) that provides methods for testing differential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models. 

To perform the respective workflows, as an example, data [GSE175779](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi) was taken from NCBI, which has experiment title: Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 Host Response in Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells from Aged Individuals, Organism: Homo sapiens, Experiment type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing.
